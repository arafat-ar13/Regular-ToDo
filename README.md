# Welcome to my ToDo List app: Regular ToDoList!!

## This app is still in beta and is in its very initial stages. There is really not anything that can be done with this app yet

Things completed:
  * A nice Home page
  * User login and sign up system
  * Admin access only to me with which I can create ToDos but anyone else cannot
  
 Things need to be accomplished:
  * Ability to add and checkoff Todos for users
  * Ability to edit Todos
  * Ability to delete Todos
  * Delete user account if they want
  * Launch the app through Heroku or PythonAnywhere
