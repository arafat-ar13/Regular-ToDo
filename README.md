# Welcome to my ToDo List app: Regular ToDoList!!

This is a todolist web app created using Django. This app is live and hosted for free by PythonAnywhere.
The app is being continuously developed by me and I am working hard to bring new features.

## Latest updates

* Dark Mode is a very popular feature these days, so I just had to implement it!
* Sort your todos by date created or by due dates.
* Introducing Sub Tasks! Break up your big task into smaller tasks and accomplish them in style!


## Features

* Users can sign up and access their account anywhere.
* Users can add, edit and delete tasks and have their tasks available anywhere they wish to use the app.
* Users have a Profile page where they can update their info and profile picture if they like.
* A personal side bar which will be continuously updated with new features and where users can access common features quickly.
* Hosted on PythonAnywhere for anyone to use.
* App is mobile friendly.
* Add tasks right from home page
* Due Date functionality added for all user accounts. Beautiful hide/show collapse effect using Bootstrap!

## Work that needs to be done

* Add pagination feature in Completed Tasks page to reduce clutter if users have completed a large number of tasks.
* Add ability for users to reset their passwords
* Add a new insights page they users can see a beautiful graph of how they are completing their tasks. Should be done using Matplotlib.
